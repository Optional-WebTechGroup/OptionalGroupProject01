2. Position Descriptions page (jobs.html)
You need to write a web page with at least 2 position descriptions. Each group will get a job title
posted on Canvas. For the second position, the choice of IT job type is entirely up to you. Why not
write a position for the ideal job you would like to do? this page must contain:
• Hierarchically structured headings of at least 2 levels
• More than one <section>
• An <aside> with appropriate content
• At least one ordered list
• At least one unordered list
• The page should also have an appropriate footer and semantic tags.
Your job descriptions should be concise but as a minimum include :
• Company’s position description reference number (5 alphanumeric characters)
• Position title
• Brief description of the position
• Salary range
• The title of the position to whom the successful applicant will report
• Key responsibilities. A list of the specific tasks that are to be performed
• Required qualifications, skills, knowledge and attributes. These should be divided into
“essential” and “preferable”. These requirements should include such things as
programming languages required, number-of-years of experience required, etc..
